# palindrome-checker
Author: Mackenzie Bannon </br>
This class implements a Deque which is implemented using a Doubly-Linked List. </br>
The program will check and verify whether an inputted string of characters is a palindrome. </br>
Note: The program is case sensitive. I.e. "A b b a" will return "No", but "a b b a" will return "Yes".
